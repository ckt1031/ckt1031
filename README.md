<h3 align="center">Why Programming?</h3>
<em>“Programming is the new literacy of the digital age, and like every other form of literacy, it empowers those who learn it to change their lives and the world around them.”</em>

<p align="center">
  I'm enthusiastic about exploring the potential of different programming languages and am driven to create tools that help make our lives better. My excitement extends to the world of AI, especially Generative AI, which holds the key to unlocking unimaginable possibilities in the future!
